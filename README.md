# Description

Udacity Nanodegree Arcade game submission in order to validate the knowledge gained during  the JavaScript Object Oriented Class and the Canvas class.

#Usage

The game is based on a classic [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) clone with twist.

Instead of trying to access the river, your goal is to collect the rubies and obtain the best score as possible.

If you touch one of the Beetle, your score is reseted.

#Extra

For extra credit I included the gem and the scoring logic. I also included a font from the Google Fonts project which match the theme of the exercise: [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P).
