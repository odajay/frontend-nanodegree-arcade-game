# Description

Udacity Nanodegree Arcade game submission in order to validate the knowledge gained during  the JavaScript Object Oriented Class and the Canvas class.
The game is based on a classic [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) clone with twist.

# How to Play

* Download all the files from the repository and open index.html to play
* Your goal is to collect the rubies and obtain the best score as possible.
* Beware! If you touch one of the Beetle, your score is reset.
* Move the keyboard directional arrows (up/down/left/right) in order to move your player.

#Extra

For extra credit I included the gem and the scoring logic. I also included a font from the Google Fonts project which match the theme of the exercise: [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P).
